The output of a feature column becomes the input to the model (using the demo function defined above, we will be able to see exactly how each column from the dataframe is transformed). A [numeric column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/numeric_column) is the simplest type of column. It is used to represent real valued features. When using this column, your model will receive the column value from the dataframe unchanged.

### Bucketized columns
Often, you don't want to feed a number directly into the model, but instead split its value into different categories based on numerical ranges. Consider raw data that represents a person's age. Instead of representing age as a numeric column, we could split the age into several buckets using a [bucketized column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/bucketized_column). Notice the one-hot values below describe which age range each row matches.

"""### Categorical columns
In this dataset, thal is represented as a string (e.g. 'fixed', 'normal', or 'reversible'). We cannot feed strings directly to a model. Instead, we must first map them to numeric values. The categorical vocabulary columns provide a way to represent strings as a one-hot vector (much like you have seen above with age buckets). The vocabulary can be passed as a list using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list), or loaded from a file using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file).

"""In a more complex dataset, many columns would be categorical (e.g. strings). Feature columns are most valuable when working with categorical data. Although there is only one categorical column in this dataset, we will use it to demonstrate several important types of feature columns that you could use when working with other datasets.

### Embedding columns
Suppose instead of having just a few possible strings, we have thousands (or more) values per category. For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1. The size of the embedding (8, in the example below) is a parameter that must be tuned.

Key point: using an embedding column is best when a categorical column has many possible values. We are using one here for demonstration purposes, so you have a complete example you can modify for a different dataset in the future.
"""

# Notice the input to the embedding column is the categorical column
# we previously created
thal_embedding = feature_column.embedding_column(thal, dimension=8)
demo(thal_embedding)

"""### Hashed feature columns

Another way to represent a categorical column with a large number of values is to use a [categorical_column_with_hash_bucket](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_hash_bucket). This feature column calculates a hash value of the input, then selects one of the `hash_bucket_size` buckets to encode a string. When using this column, you do not need to provide the vocabulary, and you can choose to make the number of hash_buckets significantly smaller than the number of actual categories to save space.

Key point: An important downside of this technique is that there may be collisions in which different strings are mapped to the same bucket. In practice, this can work well for some datasets regardless.

      'thal', hash_bucket_size=1000)

"""### Crossed feature columns
Combining features into a single feature, better known as [feature crosses](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature_cross), enables a model to learn separate weights for each combination of features. Here, we will create a new feature that is the cross of age and thal. Note that `crossed_column` does not build the full table of all possible combinations (which could be very large). Instead, it is backed by a `hashed_column`, so you can choose how large the table is.
